# Sniffing Traffic

## Concepts

- Hardware vs Software
- Span
- IPv4, IPv6 Protocols
- Promiscious Mode
- Hubs (All traffic is heard on a hub), switches (Traffic is private to it's target)
- Protocols

## Threats

- Disclosure
- DNS
- Email (SMPT, POP3, IMAC)
- Web
- Chat
- FTP
- Routes
- Telnet
- Cleartext

## Wiretapping

- MAC spoof (Take over someone MAC address to manipulate the ARP process)
- DHCP Starvation
- ARP Spoofing (Trick a switch to send someone's traffic to us)
- MAC Dup
- MAC Flood

## DHCP

- Discover
- Offer
- Request

## MAC / ARP

- CAM Table

## DNS

## Tools

- Wireshark (Filters)
- TShark
- TCP Dump
- TCP Flow

## Countermeasures

- Encryption
- Lock Ports Down
- MAC Address Assiging (Gateway)
- Static Entries
- IPv4 vs IPv6
- Tunneling
- PoLP ( principle of least privilege )
- OTP ( One time password )
- SSH
- HTTPS
