# Design Thinking

> The practice of considering a user’s experience throughout the process of creating and improving a product or service.
>
> **Note:** Information compiled from the [teamtreehouse.com](https://teamtreehouse.com/) Design Thinking course.

- User - there person(s) who will be engaging with your product.
- Empathy - the ability to understand and share the feelings of another
- As-is - the current state of a user's experience
- To-be - the future state where a design thinking solution has been employed to a user's pain to improve their experience
- Timebox - the simple act of defining a length of time that a task should take and enforcing those parameters




## Mindsets

- Assumptions

- Empathy

  ​


## Empathy map

>  A design thinking tool made of quadrants that is used to better understand the overarching traits of a user; typically outside of the context of their workflow

- Archetype - a collectively-inherited unconcious ides, pattern of though, image, etc., that is universaly present, in individual psyches.




### Data collection

**Says:** Quotes often taken from interviews or provided by assumptions.

**Does:** Consider the roles of the user in their daily lives. Such as picking the kids of from practice or balancing the family budget.

**Thinks:** Similar to 'Says', however treated as the user's internal monolog.

**Feels:** Such as "Excited about attending X event". Should be kept short!

**Buckets:** affinitized groupings of post-it notes; organied by type, concept, etc.

> Task: Spend 5 minutes as a team to group post-it notes into buckets! These will resemble themes with the user.

## Journey Maps

>  A means of documenting a user's experience from start-to-finish. Journy maps vary from practitionaer to practitioner. All journy maps seek to find a user's pain, their motivations, or design opportunities for a user. This may be likened to an empathy map but viewed over the course of an experience rather than a general view of a user during a single point in time.

- Pain Points - blockers in a user's experience. These may be emotional, technological, process-based, or physical. Severity of pain will vary with each example.

### Phases

**X axis:** (Phases) - the "chapter titles" throughout a user's experience.

**Y axis:** 

- Doing - Tend to be specific and allows many under a particular phase.
- Thinking
- Feeling

## Solving for pain

- **Prioritization** - defining the importance of action items.
- **Triage** - acting upon the prioritized action items taking care of the most important items first.



## Big ideas

- **Big idea** - a holistic and open-ended solution to a user's pain based on a user's motivation or needs.
- **Feature** - a prescriptive non-holistic response to a user's pain based in technology.
- **Vignette** - a brief but descriptive depiction of events.
- **"Getting Caught in the Weeds"** - an idiom that refers to being distracted by deails and losing sight of the intended purpose.
- **Self-compassion** - allowing for kindness and mindful forgiveness of oneself during times of failure.



## Storyboarding

> A visual form of storytelling used to show a user's journey. Comprised of panels filled with art and accompanying text.

> Note: The storyboard should reinforce the supportive solutions meant to resolve her pain points.

## Roadmap

> A time-based mapping of design decisions and the user impact of those decisions

- **Now:** What changes can we expect currently?
- **Soon:** How will our big idea manifest over the coming months?
- **Later:** Where do you see things around a year out?

> Note: The rows are the pain-points identified for a specific user.

- Keep the story simple
