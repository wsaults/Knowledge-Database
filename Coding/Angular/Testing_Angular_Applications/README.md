## 1. Introduction to testing Angular applications

- Angular was built for testing web and mobile web apps!

### 1.1 Angular testing overview

- The two primary types of tests are unit and End-to-End (E2E).

The first half of this book covers testing:
- Components, Directives, Pipes, Services, and Routing.
- We will explore tools like Jasmine, Karma, and the Angular CLI.

Components are chunks of code that can be to encapsulate certain functionality that can be then reused throughout the application. Components are types of directives except they include a view or HTML template.

Directives are used to manipulate elements that exist in teh DOM or could also add or remove elements to the DOM. Examples of directives that come included with Angular are ngFor, ngIf, and ngShow.

Pipes are used to transform data.

Services are used to fetch data and inject that data into our components.

Routes allow users to navigate from one view to the next.

The second part of this book will dive into end-to-end testing using Protractor.
