## Getting Started with React Router



### Expand Your React Skills

Routing is the process of matching a URL to the set of components being rendered. Routing dynamically loads components and changes what's displayed in the browser as users navigate an app, all without reloading the page. React does not have built-in routing features, so developrs rely on React Router, an external library designed specifially for React.
