## Getting Started with React Router



### Expand Your React Skills

Routing is the process of matching a URL to the set of components being rendered. Routing dynamically loads components and changes what's displayed in the browser as users navigate an app, all without reloading the page. React does not have built-in routing features, so developrs rely on React Router, an external library designed specifially for React.



### What is Routing?

In single-page apps (SPAs), routing is responsible for loading and unloading content while matching the URL with the set of components being rendered. Routing should also keep track of browser history and link users to specific sections of your app.



### Installing React Router and Declaring Routes

Use the following terminal command to save React Router to the project.

```
npm install --save react-router-dom
```



**Terms:**

- <BrowserRouter> // Route routing component which keeps your UI in sync with the url
- <Route> // Renders a component in the app when it's url matches the path



Use `Route` components inside `BrowserRouter` to load components like `Home` and `About` depending on the url.

> Note: use the keyword `exact` to let `route` know that the path should match exactly.


```jsx
const App = () => (
  <BrowserRouter>
  <div className="container">
    <Header /> // This component stays and isn't dependent on the path.
    <Route exact path="/" component={Home} /> // Renders the Home component when the url is "/"
    <Route path="/about" component={About} />
  </div>
  </BrowserRouter>
);
```



### Inline Rendering with <Route>

Replace `component` with `render` to load a component via an arrow function. This gives you the ability to pass props to the component.

```jsx
<Route path="/about" render={ () => <About title='About' /> } />
```
